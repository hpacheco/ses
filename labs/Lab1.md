# Lab 1 - Low-level security

One of the most common source vulnerabilities, even to this day, remains to be related to exploits for low-level programming languages such as C or C++. C and C++ are very insecure and error-prone languages, and one of the main sources of problems is memory access errors. For instance, many of the [2021 Top 25 CWEs](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2021/2021_cwe_top25.html) are due to memory violations, type violations or undefined behavior in C or similar languages.

Instead of focusing on exploitation and mitigation, we will study how various existing analysis tools can support developers in detecting and fixing vulnerabilities.

In this lab we will use a series of C examples that are part of the [SARD test suite](https://samate.nist.gov/SRD/testsuite.php#sardsuites). Each example comes as a pair of C programs where the first has a flaw and the second demonstrates how to possibly fix the flaw.

## [Dynamic Application Security Testing](https://oaklandsok.github.io/papers/song2019.pdf)

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is typically used to denote analysis methods that examine an application as itâ€™s running to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. They therefore focus on dynamically examining - at runtime - a single run of an application.

### [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)

Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools that works as an interpreter for compiled binaries, without the need to recompile the program or have access to the source code. Much like GDB, it can be used as a low-level debugger; since it instruments the original program at runtime, it may introduce a 20x-50x slowdown in program execution.

One of the most prominent Valgrind tools is the Memcheck memory error detector, which can find uses of freed or invalid memory, memory leaks, or uses of uninitialized memory. A detailed error list can be found in the [manual](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html#mc-manual.bugs).

#### Memory error - [buffer overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)

Consider a simple [scpy7-bad.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/079/scpy7-bad.c) vulnerable C program found:

```C
#define	MAXSIZE		40
void
test(char *str)
{
	char *buf;

	buf = malloc(MAXSIZE);
	if(!buf)
		return;
	strcpy(buf, str);				/* FLAW */
	printf("result: %s\n", buf);
	free(buf);
}
```

This program allocates 40 bytes of heap memory for a buffer, to which it comes some input `str`. There is a likely heap buffer overflow vulnerability, if the size of `str` is larger than 40 (the size of `buf`), which may lead to an exploit.
If we compile and run this program with a slightly larger input, however:
```ShellSession
$ gcc scpy7-bad.c
$ /a.out aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa             
result: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```
the program does not crash although `strcpy` is writing past the buffer.

We can analyze the same program execution with `valgrind` and obtain indicative errors that `strcpy`is performing invalid writes:

#### [Memory leak](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Memory_leak)

Consider a simple program [memory_leak_basic-bad.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/189/memory_leak_basic-bad.c).

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	double *buff = (double *)NULL;
	buff = malloc(10 * sizeof(double));
	if (buff == (double *)NULL)
	{
		printf ("Allocation Error: Cannot allocate buff.\n");
		exit(0);		
	}
	// do something	
	buff = NULL;                                        /* FLAW */
	return 0;
}
```

This program has a memory leak, since the buffer `buff` is not freed after before the variable is reassigned.
Although this vulnerability does not affect the behavior of the program, it may clause a program to crash or run too slow due to excessive memory consumption. Valgrind will detect this leak:

#### [Use-after-free](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Using_freed_memory)

Consider a simple program [useafterfree-bad.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/219/useafterfree-bad.c) that allocates some memory but uses the variable after being freed:

```C
int main(){
      char * x = (char *) malloc(4);
      if (x == NULL)
        {printf("Memory allocation problem"); return 1;}
      free(x);
      if(x) *x = 'a';									/* FLAW */
      return 0;
}
```
This vulnerability will often cause the program to crash, and, if the freed memory gets reused, an attacker may control `x` similarly to a buffer overflow attack.
Valgrind will also detect this error:

### [Address Sanitizer](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer)

AddressSanitizer is another runtime memory error detector. It is developed by Google and works by instrumenting a LLVM program at compile-time, and is currently implemented in the Clang and GCC compilers. It therefore requires recompiling the program with the necessary flag. The runtime slowdown of the instrumented program is around 2x. In fact, there are multiple available [sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers) to catch different categories of errors (you may combine multiple analysis options):
* `-fsanitize=address` for memory errors;
* `-fsanitize=leak` for memory leaks;
* `-fsanitize=memory` for uses of undefined memory;
* `-fsanitize=undefined` for undefined behavior that is not in the C standard, see the [documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html#ubsan-checks) for more details.

####  [Buffer overflow](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Buffer_Overflow)

Consider a simple program [scpy2-bad.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/077/scpy2-bad.c) with a stack buffer overflow vulnerability:

```C
#define	MAXSIZE		40
void
test(char *str)
{
	char buf[MAXSIZE];

	if(strlen(str) > MAXSIZE)
		return;
	strcpy(buf, str);				/* FLAW */
	printf("result: %s\n", buf);
}
```

When the input `str` is larger or equal than than `MAXSIZE`, the `strcpy` function will overflow the buffer `buf`, since the terminating '\0' character occupies and additional byte. The check however only tests for a larger `str`. If we compile our program with a recent Clang version with the address sanitizer on, it will detect an error for inputs of size `MAXSIZE`.

#### [Undefined behavior](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Undefined_Behavior)

Consider the program [cwe190_ex2_bad.c](../c/misc/cwe190_ex2_bad.c) that contains a known vulnerable excerpt from OpenSSH 3.3, and reported in [CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html):

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int packet_get_int() {
  return 1073741824;
}

char* packet_get_string(char *arg) {
  return "";
}

int main(void) {
  int i, nresp;
  char **response;
  nresp = packet_get_int();
  if (nresp > 0) {
    response = malloc(nresp* (int) sizeof(char*));
    for (i = 0; i < nresp; i++) response[i] = packet_get_string(NULL);
  }
}
```

If the result of function `packet_get_int` is a large signed integer such that its multiplication by `sizeof(char*)` (typically 4 or 8 for 32-bit or 64-bit architectures, respectively) does not fit into a signed integer, the signed integer multiplication will overflow, causing `malloc` to allocate 0 bytes and the following loop to crash the program.

Since signed integer overflows are undefined behavior in the C standard ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow)), we can compile with the `undefined` sanitizer to find this error at runtime:

### [Taintgrind](https://github.com/wmkhoo/taintgrind)

Taintgrind is a taint-tracking plugin for Valgrind. The purpose of taint analysis is to track information flow from sources to sinks within a program. As a binary instrumentation tool, Taintgrind allows marking specific bytes - typically user input data - as tainted and propagates taint at the byte level through memory operations. 

#### Direct flows

Consider for instance the program [os_cmd_injection_basic-bad.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/241/os_cmd_injection_basic-bad.c) that shows the content of a user-supplied file and contains a classical command injection [vulnerability](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html): the user may append additional bash commands to the input, that will get executed. The most relevant snippet is the following:
```C
	strncpy(command, cat, catLength);
	strncpy(command + catLength, argv[1], commandLength - catLength);
	if (system(command) < 0) { ... }
```
The user-supplied string, stored in `argv[1]`, is appended to the string `command` that will be executed within a `system` call. The cause of this vulnerability is therefore that a critical operation (the system call) depends on user input.

We can use Taintgrind-specific flags to mark the first 8 bytes of `argv[1]` as tainted, and print the taint status of each block of 8 bytes in the `command` string. File [os_cmd_injection_basic-bad-taintgrind.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/241/os_cmd_injection_basic-bad-taintgrind.c) has the full instrumentation.
```C
TNT_TAINT(argv[1],8);
strncpy(command, cat, catLength);
strncpy(command + catLength, argv[1], commandLength - catLength);
unsigned int t;
for (int i=0; i < commandLength; ) {
  TNT_IS_TAINTED(t,command+i,8);
  printf("%08x ",t);
  i+=8;
}
if (system(command) < 0) { ... }
```

We can now compile the instrumented program and run it with Taintgrind. Note how the outcome of the analysis taints exactly 8 bytes of the input that are copied to the output bytes (note that each 8-byte block is printed in reverse order since `amd64` uses a little endian representation).

$ dot -Tsvg log.dot -o log.svg
```

</details>

#### Indirect flows

Taintgrind only considers direct flows as information for propagating taint; indirect flows - e.g., when a memory adress depends on a variable used for calculating a conditional branch - are not captured by the analysis. We can confirm this with a sample program [sign-32-taintgrind.c](../c/misc/sign32-taintgrind.c) with an indirect flow in the following function:
```C
int get_sign(int x) {
    if (x == 0) return 0;
    if (x < 0)  return -1;
    return 1;
}
```
In this function, the value of the output depends on the value of the input variable `x`, however, `x` is not directly assigned/copied to the output. If we run Taintgrind on this example it will signal no taint as expected:

```ShellSession

Like Taintgrind, it uses a byte-level memory tracking to propagate taint through the execution of a C program; but unlike Taintgrind, it works by instrumenting the C program at compilation time. This requires that taint will only be precisely tracked for code that has been compiled with support for DataFlowSanitizer. If your program depends on external libraries, you will need to recompile these or pass additional information to DataFlowSanitizer (see the documentation).

#### Direct flows

Consider the [os_cmd_injection_basic-bad-dfsan.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/241/os_cmd_injection_basic-bad-dfsan.c), instrumented with DataFlowSanitizer taint trackers. Taint labels are unsigned integers, that can be applied to memory blocks. The relevant snippet is the following:
```C
dfsan_label argv1_label = 1;
dfsan_set_label(argv1_label,argv[1],8);
strncpy(command, cat, catLength);
strncpy(command + catLength, argv[1], commandLength - catLength);
dfsan_label command_label;
for (int i=0; i < commandLength; ) {
  command_label = dfsan_read_label(command+i,8);
  printf("%u ",command_label);
  i+=8;
}
if (system(command) < 0) { ... }
```

If we compile and run this program, we can see that two byte blocks of the output are tainted with label 1 (0 is the default non-tainted label).

```ShellSession
$ clang-13 -fsanitize=dataflow os_cmd_injection_basic-bad-dfsan.c
$ ./a.out aaaaaaaa                        
/bin/cat: aaaaaaaa: No such file or directory
0 1 1
```

#### Indirect flows

Similarly to Taintgrind, DataFlowSanitizer only considers direct information flows by default.
Recall the [sign-32-dfsan.c](../c/misc/sign32-dfsan.c) example, with an indirect flow in the `get_sign` function, now instrumented with DataFlowSanitizer support.

If we compile and run this program, DataFlowSanitizer will not detect our indirect flow:
<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```ShellSession
$ clang-13 -fsanitize=dataflow sign32-dfsan.c
$ ./a.out                                                    
a.out: sign32.c:18: int main(int, char **): Assertion `dfsan_has_label(s_label, a_label)' failed.
zsh: abort      ./a.out
```
</details>

In the working version of Clang 15, there is however an experimental LLVM feature `-dfsan-conditional-callbacks`  that adds conditional support to DataFlowSanitizer. We can try a similar patch to LLVM that is pre-bundled in this [repository](https://github.com/mcopik/clang-dfsan).
Follow these steps:
<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

1. Clone the repository and build. This will create a docker image with Clang/LLVM built for indirect control-flow tainting support.
```ShellSession
$ git clone https://github.com/mcopik/clang-dfsan
$ cd clang-dfsan
$ sudo sh build-cfsan.sh
````
2. Launch a shell inside a new docker container for the built docker image. Change the `/home/kali` shared folder appropriately.
```ShellSession
$ sudo docker run -v /home/kali:/home/kali -it mcopik/clang-dfsan:cfsan-9.0 
```
3. Inside the container, move into the `examplefolder` directory (change this) and compile it. Exit the container.
```ShellSession
docker@container$ cd examplefolder
docker@container$ clang-cfsan sign32-dfsan.c
docker@container$ exit
$
```
4. Outside the container, you may run the example. If the assertion raises no error, taint was tracked as expected.
```ShellSession
$ cd examplefolder
$ ./a.out
$
```

## [Static Application Security Testing](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/1/257444-static-analysis/fulltext)

 Static application security testing (SAST) is typically used to denote analysis methods that examine the code of a program to find flaws and weaknesses that may be exploited by an attacker. They therefore focus on statically examining - at compile-time - all the possible runs of an application.

### [Scan-build](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html)

The scan-build utility is a static analysis tool provided by LLVM for detecting programming errors in C/C++ programs.

Consider the [scpy7-bad.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/079/scpy7-bad.c) C program from before that has a buffer overflow vulnerability.
Running `scan-build` on this example will generate a report that signals the call to `strcpy` as unsafe with a contextualization of the associated CWE; you can also graphically visualize the report.

<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```ShellSession

### [IKOS](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/opensource/ikos/)

IKOS is a static analyzer for C/C++ based on the theory of [Abstract Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation).
Its analysis is based on LLVM and allows proving the absence of runtime errors in resulting applications.
As a static analysis tool that covers all program executions (e.g. for any input), it is not as precise as a dynamic analysis that covers a single program execution (e.g., for a specific input). IKOS performs a sound over-approximation of the behavior of a program, meaning that analysis may fail to prove that a safe program is safe, but proven programs are always safe.

Consider the program [cwe190_ex2_bad.c](c/misc/cwe190_ex2_bad.c) program from before. IKOS will statically detect the signed integer overflow in the `malloc` argument which makes our program unsafe:
<details>

```ShellSession

```
</details>

You may notice that the `ikos` utility also generates a `output.db` file with a log of the performed analysis, in the folder where it was invoked. You can also graphically inspect this log with the `ikos-view` tool:
```ShellSession
$ ikos-view output.db

We can also analyze a similar program [cwe190_ex2_ok.c](c/misc/cwe190_ex2_ok.c) with a fixed value for `nresp` that does not overflow.
IKOS no longer reports the overflow, however, the program is still potentially unsafe, namely if `malloc` fails to allocate memory and returns a `NULL` pointer:

```
</details>

We can fix this uncertainty by making to check that the result of `malloc` is not `NULL`, as in [cwe190_ex2_ok.c](c/misc/cwe190_ex2_ok.c). IKOS now reports that our program is safe:

### [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/)

Frama-C is a source code analysis platform that aims at conducting verification of industrial-size programs written in ISO C99 source code. Frama-C supports the formal verification approach of analyzing a C implementation with respect to a functional specification of the ISO C99 standard, and provides to its users with a collection of [plugins](https://frama-c.com/html/kernel-plugin.html) that perform static and dynamic analysis for safety and security critical software. As an industrial project, some of Frama-C's plugins are [open-sourced](https://git.frama-c.com/pub/frama-c), while others are proprietary.

Frama-C's Eva plugin has been developed to statically show the absence of runtime errors on whole programs. It will perform a value analysis that (over-)estimates the set of possible values for each variables.
Consider the program [cwe190_ex2_bad.c](c/misc/cwe190_ex2_bad.c) program from before. The Frama-C Eva plugin will statically detect the signed integer overflow in the `malloc` argument:

Frama-C also offers a GUI that you may simply invoke as:
```ShellSession
$ frama-c-gui cwe190_ex2_bad.c  
```
You can graphically configure the analysis plugins in the `Analyses` menu, where all the command-line plugin options are also available.
For instance, we can replicate the above Eva analysis and see the errors as annotations in the code:

We can also analyze a similar program [cwe190_ex2_ok.c](c/misc/cwe190_ex2_ok.c) with a fixed value for `nresp` that does not overflow.
Eva no longer reports the overflow, however, we get a different out of bounds error:

</details>

This error occurs because Eva assumes by default that the `malloc` function may always fail, e.g. if there is insufficient available memory, To avoid this error, we can pass an additional `-eva-no-alloc-returns-null` flag to the analysis.

</details>

This example is now analyzed with no errors and alarms, indicating that our program is safe.
The precision (in tradeoff with efficiency) of the Eva plugin is highly configurable. If you encounter issues when analysing other examples, you may check the Eva [documentation](https://frama-c.com/fc-plugins/eva.html) page for more information about the Eva analysis and its optional flags.

#### User-supplied proof annotations

It is important to stress that Frama-C is *not* particularly designed to be used as an automated SAST framework that typically scans a code base for known vulnerabilities.
Since Frama-C needs to consider all possible program behaviours, it will often fail to automatically discard all proof obligations that it generates for a program, and user-supplied annotations or domain restrictions may be necessary to guide the verification engine; such a tradeoff between precision and automation is common to all static analysis methods.

In this lab we will not delve into the details of the different analyses that Frama-C supports, nor attempt to give a crash course on formal program verification.
Nonetheless, for demonstrative purposes, consider the CWE 190 example from before, but where the `packet_get_int` is left abstract and no longer returns a fixed number; this poses a challenge for verification as the number of iterations of the loop cannot be decided statically and inferring precise constraints for dynamically-allocated memory is often complicated. We illustrate two possible approaches:
* [c/misc/cwe190_ex2_ok1-frama-c.c](../c/misc/cwe190_ex2_ok1-frama-c.c): a user can supply additional annotations (and assumptions) to guide the proof that a general program is safe for any input;
* [c/misc/cwe190_ex2_ok2-frama-c.c](../c/misc/cwe190_ex2_ok2-frama-c.c): if the range of possible inputs is a computationally small enough set, we can instruct Frama-C's Eva analysis to exhaustively search all possible program paths.

You may run and test both examples with:
```bash
frama-c-gui -wp -eva -eva-no-alloc-returns-null c/misc/<examplename>.c
```
For more information on the concrete proof techniques you may consult the Frama-C [documentation](https://frama-c.com/html/documentation.html).
You can also have a look at more challenging Frama-C case studies in these repositories:
* [https://git.frama-c.com/pub/open-source-case-studies](https://git.frama-c.com/pub/open-source-case-studies)
* [https://git.frama-c.com/pub/sate-6/-/tree/master](https://git.frama-c.com/pub/sate-6/-/tree/master)

#### Taint analysis

The Frama-C Eva plugin also provides an experimental form of static taint analysis that performs of a data-dependency analysis, possibly assisted by user annotations. The Eva analysis propagates taint by computing an over-approximation of the set of tainted locations at each program point. Programmers can then supply special `taint` clauses and contracts that encode typical taint sources and sinks and will to be verified along-side the standard program analysis.

##### Simple example

Consider the [c/misc/sign32_direct-frama-c.c](../c/misc/sign32_direct-frama-c.c) program:
```C
int get_sign(int x) {
    if (x == 0) return 0;
    if (x < 0)  return -1;
    return 1;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int a = 1000;
    //@ taint a;
    int s = get_sign(a);
    //@ assert !\tainted(s);
    
    return s;
}
```
The first annotation marks the input variable `a` as a taint source; the second asks Frama-C if the variable `s` - computed from `a` - is **not** a tant sink. In general, Frama-C won't be able to prove that memory is not tainted, e.g., due to semantic over-approximations; Frama-C taint analysis is rather designed to reason about when some memory location is definitely not tainted.
If you can run this example using the Eva taint domain:
<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```ShellSession
$ frama-c-gui -wp -eva -eva-domains taint c/misc/sign32_direct_frama-c.c
```
![lab1-framac-taintd](lab1-framac-taintd.png)
</details>
The result may be slightly surprising, but it highlights that Frama-C's taint analysis only considers direct information flows; the input ``x`` is never directly assigned to the output of the function, and only indirectly the output by affecting the conditional clauses.


Although we can not reason about indirect flows, we can change the default tainting behavior of `get_sign` by explicitly specifying a taint contract.
Consider the [c/misc/sign32_indirect-frama-c.c](../c/misc/sign32_indirect-frama-c.c) program:
```C
/*@ ensures \tainted(\result) <==> \tainted(x);
  @ assigns \result \from x;
*/ 
int get_sign(int x);

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int a = 1000;
    //@ taint a;
    int s = get_sign(a);
    //@ assert !\tainted(s);
    
    return s;
}
```
This time, we specify that function `get_sign` produces a result that is as tainted as its input; note that it is important to leave the definition of `get_sign` abstract, or else our annotated post-condition and the default taint analysis for the body of the function could lead to logical inconsistencies.
You can run this example:
<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```ShellSession
$ frama-c-gui -wp -eva -eva-domains taint c/misc/sign32_indirect_frama-c.c
```
![lab1-framac-tainti](lab1-framac-tainti.png)
</details>
The result is as expected: variable `s` is possibly tainted and the second assertion fails.

##### Command injection

Let's consider a simplified version [c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/241/os_cmd_injection_basic-bad-frama-c.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/241/os_cmd_injection_basic-bad-frama-c.c) of the command injection example from before, where we construct a string that shows the content of an argument file with name passed as an argument. For asking Frama-C if our executed command is tainted by the input, the relevant snippet is the following:
```C
//@ taint argv[0..strlen(argv)];
...
strncpy(command, cat, catLength);
strncpy(command + catLength, argv, commandLength - catLength);
//@ assert !\tainted(command[0..catLength-1]);
//@ assert !\tainted(command[0..commandLength-1]);
```
We can run the program as follows:
<details>
<summary>Result</summary>

```ShellSession
$ frama-c-gui -wp -eva- eva-domains taint -eva-no-alloc-returns-null -eva-context-valid-pointers c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/149/241/os_cmd_injection_basic-bad-frama-c.c
```
![lab1_framac_cmdi_bad](lab1_framac_cmdi_bad.png)

Looking at the output, Frama-C has correctly separated the command's prefix from the command's argument. Thus, the first assertion is true, since we have not tainted the prefix, while the second assertion is false, since we have tainted the prefix.

We can also analyze a good version [c/SARD-testsuite-101/000/149/242/os_cmd_injection_basic-good-frama-c.c](../c/SARD-testsuite-101/000/149/242/os_cmd_injection_basic-good-frama-c.c) of the program that sanitizes the input with a function `purify`. For that purpose, we can write a contract saying that `purify` always returns an untainted array, irrespective of its inputs:
```C
//@ ensures !\tainted(buff[0..buffLength-1]);
void purify(char *buff,size_t buffLength);

//@ taint argv[0..strlen(argv)];
...
strncpy(command, cat, catLength);
strncpy(command + catLength, argv, commandLength - catLength);
//@ assert !\tainted(command[0..catLength-1]);
//@ assert !\tainted(command[0..commandLength-1]);
```
We can run the program as before:

Given our assumptions, Frama-C is now able to prove that the executed `command` string is not tainted.

## Tasks

The goal of this lab is to experiment with the above described dynamic and static analysis to detect and fix the vulnerabilities found in example C programs from the [SARD] testsuites. 
0. Study and try out the tools described above.
1. Choose two vulnerable programs *under different categories* from [c/SARD-testsuite-100](c/SARD-testsuite-100) to analyse.
2. For each chosen vulnerable program under `c/SARD-testsuite-100/000/140/i`, find and study the equivalent but more secure program under `c/SARD-testsuite-101/000/140/i+1`.
